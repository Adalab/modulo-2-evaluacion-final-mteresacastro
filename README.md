# Module 2 Final Evaluation - Adalab Promo-U

This project is developed thanks to the knowledge acquired after receiving the lessons of module 2 of Adalab. It is intended for teachers to be able to evaluate whether I have met the necessary requirements, and also for me, to check my progress and see how I have performed putting into practice all the skills obtained from JS.

The exercise consists of developing a web application to search for TV series, which allows us un/mark the series as favorites and save them in local storage.
The exercise also has a layout part with HTML and Sass, we recommend you dedicate effort to the layout once the JavaScript part is finished, since the evaluation criteria are related to the latter.
